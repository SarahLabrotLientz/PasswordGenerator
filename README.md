# PasswordGenerator
Generates passwords based on user selected criteria



This is a password generator. After clicking the provided button, a user selects certain criteria and receives a new password. It creates very secure passwords. Nobody will be able to log onto your accounts, not even you. 

HOW IT WORKS:
If someone clicks on the button "Generate Password" then they are prompted for the password's length. The password needs to be between 8-30 characters.  
If a user doesn't meet this range, then the prompt will loop until the user enters a number within the range. Once the length is determined, then the user is prompted to select one of the following: special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers in their password. They must select at least one of these options inorder for all criteria to be defined and a password to be generated.
